# Project of Sample CDFs to create a Baseline Platform

## Overview
   I've created this project to help experiment with, build future knowledge and help simplify CF needed for a platform.
   
### Objectives
   KISS principles, each stack should do 1 and only 1 action, where tight coupling makes sense like EBs or logical grouping like LBs Auto Scaling, Launch configs Ec2 etc.. are fine to
   live in a single stack however the idea here is to ensure the code of each stack is consumable by the average reader and doesn't become convoluted scripts that requires Robert
   Langdon to decipher.
